    "alcoholrelated disorders": "alcohol use disorder alcohol intoxication alcohol withdrawal other alcoholinduced disorders unspecified alcoholrelated disorder",
    "alcohol use disorder": "bipolar disorders schizophrenia and antisocial personality disorder are associated with a markedly increased rate of alcohol use disorder and several anxiety and depressive disorders alcohol intoxication 497 may relate to alcohol use disorder as well at least a part of the reported association between depression and moderate to severe alcohol use disorder may be attributable to temporary al coholinduced comorbid depressive symptoms resulting from the acute effects of intoxication or withdrawal severe repeated alcohol intoxication may also suppress immune mechanisms and predispose individuals to infections and increase the risk for cancers",
    "alcohol intoxication": "alcohol intoxication may occur comorbidly with other substance intoxication especially in individuals with conduct disorder or antisocial personality disorder",
    "alcohol withdrawal": "withdrawal is more likely to occur with heavier alcohol intake and that might be most of ten observed in individuals with conduct disorder and antisocial personality disorder withdrawal states are also more severe in older individuals individuals who are also de pendent on other depressant drugs sedativehypnotics and individuals who have had more alcohol withdrawal experiences in the past 502 substancerelated and addictive disorders",
    "other alcoholinduced disorders": "the following alcoholinduced disorders are described in other chapters of the manual with disorders with which they share phenomenology see the substancemedicationinduced mental disorders in these chapters alcoholinduced psychotic disorder schizophrenia spec trum and other psychotic disorders alcoholinduced bipolar disorder bipolar and related disorders alcoholinduced depressive disorder depressive disorders alcohol induced anxiety disorder anxiety disorders alcoholinduced sleep disorder sleep wake disorders alcoholinduced sexual dysfunction sexual dysfunctions and alcohol induced major or mild neurocognitive disorder neurocognitive disorders for alcohol intoxication delirium and alcohol withdrawal delirium see the criteria and discussion of de lirium in the chapter neurocognitive disorders these alcoholinduced disorders are diag nosed instead of alcohol intoxication or alcohol withdrawal only when the symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention",
    "features": "the symptom profiles for an alcoholinduced condition resemble independent mental disor ders as described elsewhere in dsm5 however the alcoholinduced disorder is temporary and observed after severe intoxication with andor withdrawal from alcohol while the symp toms can be identical to those of independent mental disorders eg psychoses major depres sive disorder and while they can have the same severe consequences eg suicide attempts alcoholinduced conditions are likely to improve without formal treatment in a matter of days to weeks after cessation of severe intoxication andor withdrawal each alcoholinduced mental disorder is listed in the relevant diagnostic section and there fore only a brief description is offered here alcoholinduced disorders must have developed in the context of severe intoxication andor withdrawal from the substance capable of produc ing the mental disorder in addition there must be evidence that the disorder being observed is not likely to be better explained by another nonalcoholinduced mental disorder the latter is likely to occur if the mental disorder was present before the severe intoxication or with drawal or continued more than 1 month after the cessation of severe intoxication andor with drawal when symptoms are observed only during a delirium they should be considered part of the delirium and not diagnosed separately as many symptoms including disturbances in mood anxiety and reality testing are commonly seen during agitated confused states the al coholinduced disorder must be clinically relevant causing significant levels of distress or sig nificant functional impairment finally there are indications that the intake of substances of abuse in the context of a preexisting mental disorder are likely to result in an intensification of the preexisting independent syndrome the features associated with each relevant major mental disorder eg psychotic epi sodes major depressive disorder are similar whether observed with an independent or an alcoholinduced condition however individuals with alcoholinduced disorders are likely to also demonstrate the associated features seen with an alcohol use disorder as listed in the subsections of this chapter rates of alcoholinduced disorders vary somewhat by diagnostic category for exam ple the lifetime risk for major depressive episodes in individuals with alcohol use disorder is approximately 40 but only about onethird to onehalf of these represent independent major depressive syndromes observed outside the context of intoxication similar rates of alcoholinduced sleep and anxiety conditions are likely but alcoholinduced psychotic ep isodes are fairly rare",
    "development and course": "once present the symptoms of an alcoholinduced condition are likely to remain clinically relevant as long as the individual continues to experience severe intoxication andor with unspecified alcoholrelated disorder 503 drawal while the symptoms are identical to those of independent mental disorders eg psychoses major depressive disorder and while they can have the same severe conse quences eg suicide attempts all alcoholinduced syndromes other than alcohol induced neurocognitive disorder amnestic confabulatory type alcoholinduced persist ing amnestic disorder regardless of the severity of the symptoms are likely to improve relatively quickly and unlikely to remain clinically relevant for more than 1 month after cessation of severe intoxication andor withdrawal the alcoholinduced disorders are an important part of the differential diagnoses for the independent mental conditions independent schizophrenia major depressive disor der bipolar disorder and anxiety disorders such as panic disorder are likely to be asso ciated with much longerlasting periods of symptoms and often require longerterm medications to optimize the probability of improvement or recovery the alcoholinduced conditions on the other hand are likely to be much shorter in duration and disappear within several days to 1 month after cessation of severe intoxication andor withdrawal even without psychotropic medications the importance of recognizing an alcoholinduced disorder is similar to the relevance of identifying the possible role of some endocrine conditions and medication reactions be fore diagnosing an independent mental disorder in light of the high prevalence of alcohol use disorders worldwide it is important that these alcoholinduced diagnoses be consid ered before independent mental disorders are diagnosed",
    "unspecified alcoholrelated disorder": "this category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of an alcohol related disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social occupa tional or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any specific alcoholrelated disorder or any of the disorders in the substancerelated and addictive disorders diagnostic class",
    "caffeinerelated disorders": "caffeine intoxication caffeine withdrawal other caffeineinduced disorders unspecified caffeinerelated disorder",
    "caffeine intoxication": "a recent consumption of caffeine typically a high dose well in excess of 250 mg b five or more of the following signs or symptoms developing during or shortly after caffeine use 1 restlessness 2 nervousness"
