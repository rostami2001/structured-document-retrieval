    "another medical condition": "delirium a separate diagnosis of anxiety disorder due to another medical condition is not given if the anxiety disturbance occurs exclusively during the course of a delirium however a diagnosis of anxiety disorder due to another medical condition may be given in addition to a diagnosis of major neurocognitive disorder dementia if the etiology of anxiety is judged to be a physiological consequence of the pathological process causing the neurocognitive disorder and if anxiety is a prominent part of the clinical presentation mixed presentation of symptoms eg mood and anxiety if the presentation includes a mix of different types of symptoms the specific mental disorder due to another medical condition depends on which symptoms predominate in the clinical picture substancemedicationinduced anxiety disorder if there is evidence of recent or pro longed substance use including medications with psychoactive effects withdrawal from 232 anxiety disorders a substance or exposure to a toxin a substancemedicationinduced anxiety disorder should be considered certain medications are known to increase anxiety eg corticoste roids estrogens metoclopramide and when this is the case the medication may be the most likely etiology although it may be difficult to distinguish whether the anxiety is at tributable to the medications or to the medical illness itself when a diagnosis of substance induced anxiety is being made in relation to recreational or nonprescribed drugs it may be useful to obtain a urine or blood drug screen or other appropriate laboratory evaluation symptoms that occur during or shortly after ie within 4 weeks of substance intoxication or withdrawal or after medication use may be especially indicative of a substancemedi cationinduced anxiety disorder depending on the type duration or amount of the sub stance used if the disturbance is associated with both another medical condition and substance use both diagnoses ie anxiety disorder due to another medical condition and substancemedicationinduced anxiety disorder can be given features such as onset af ter age 45 years or the presence of atypical symptoms during a panic attack eg vertigo loss of consciousness loss of bladder or bowel control slurred speech amnesia suggest the possibility that another medical condition or a substance may be causing the panic at tack symptoms anxiety disorder not due to a known medical condition anxiety disorder due to an other medical condition should be distinguished from other anxiety disorders especially panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder in other anxiety disorders no specific and direct causative physiological mechanisms associated with another medical condition can be demonstrated late age at onset atypical symptoms and the absence of a personal or family history of anxiety disorders suggest the need for a thorough assessment to rule out the diagnosis of anxiety disorder due to another medical condition anxiety disorders can exacerbate or pose increased risk for medical conditions such as cardiovascular events and myocardial infarction and should not be diagnosed as anxiety disorder due to another medical condition in these cases illness anxiety disorder anxiety disorder due to another medical condition should be distinguished from illness anxiety disorder illness anxiety disorder is characterized by worry about illness concern about pain and bodily preoccupations in the case of illness anxiety disorder individuals may or may not have diagnosed medical conditions al though an individual with illness anxiety disorder and a diagnosed medical condition is likely to experience anxiety about the medical condition the medical condition is not physiologically related to the anxiety symptoms adjustment disorders anxiety disorder due to another medical condition should be distinguished from adjustment disorders with anxiety or with anxiety and depressed mood adjustment disorder is warranted when individuals experience a maladaptive re sponse to the stress of having another medical condition the reaction to stress usually concerns the meaning or consequences of the stress as compared with the experience of anxiety or mood symptoms that occur as a physiological consequence of the other medical condition in adjustment disorder the anxiety symptoms are typically related to coping with the stress of having a general medical condition whereas in anxiety disorder due to another medical condition individuals are more likely to have prominent physical symp toms and to be focused on issues other than the stress of the illness itself associated feature of another mental disorder anxiety symptoms may be an associ ated feature of another mental disorder eg schizophrenia anorexia nervosa other specified or unspecified anxiety disorder this diagnosis is given if it cannot be determined whether the anxiety symptoms are primary substanceinduced or associated with another medical condition other specified anxiety disorder 233",
    "other specified anxiety disorder": "this category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of an anxiety dis order that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social occupational or oth er important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the anxiety disorders diagnostic class the other specified anxiety disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific anxiety disorder this is done by recording other specified anxiety disorder followed by the specific reason eg generalized anxiety not occurring more days than not examples of presentations that can be specified using the other specified designation include the following 1 limitedsymptom attacks 2 generalized anxiety not occurring more days than not 3 khy√¢l cap wind attacks see glossary of cultural concepts of distress in the ap pendix 4 ataque de nervios attack of nerves see glossary of cultural concepts of distress in the appendix",
