    "disorders": "ety and related behavioral disturbances fear is the emotional response to real or per ceived imminent threat whereas anxiety is anticipation of future threat obviously these two states overlap but they also differ with fear more often associated with surges of au tonomic arousal necessary for fight or flight thoughts of immediate danger and escape behaviors and anxiety more often associated with muscle tension and vigilance in prep aration for future danger and cautious or avoidant behaviors sometimes the level of fear or anxiety is reduced by pervasive avoidance behaviors panic attacks feature prominently within the anxiety disorders as a particular type of fear response panic attacks are not lim ited to anxiety disorders but rather can be seen in other mental disorders as well the anxiety disorders differ from one another in the types of objects or situations that induce fear anxiety or avoidance behavior and the associated cognitive ideation thus while the anxiety disorders tend to be highly comorbid with each other they can be dif ferentiated by close examination of the types of situations that are feared or avoided and the content of the associated thoughts or beliefs anxiety disorders differ from developmentally normative fear or anxiety by being ex cessive or persisting beyond developmentally appropriate periods they differ from tran sient fear or anxiety often stressinduced by being persistent eg typically lasting 6 months or more although the criterion for duration is intended as a general guide with allowance for some degree of flexibility and is sometimes of shorter duration in children as in sepa ration anxiety disorder and selective mutism since individuals with anxiety disorders typically overestimate the danger in situations they fear or avoid the primary determina tion of whether the fear or anxiety is excessive or out of proportion is made by the clinician taking cultural contextual factors into account many of the anxiety disorders develop in childhood and tend to persist if not treated most occur more frequently in females than in males approximately 21 ratio each anxiety disorder is diagnosed only when the symp toms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substancemedication or to another medical condition or are not better explained by another mental disorder the chapter is arranged developmentally with disorders sequenced according to the typical age at onset the individual with separation anxiety disorder is fearful or anxious about separation from attachment figures to a degree that is developmentally inappro priate there is persistent fear or anxiety about harm coming to attachment figures and events that could lead to loss of or separation from attachment figures and reluctance to go away from attachment figures as well as nightmares and physical symptoms of distress al though the symptoms often develop in childhood they can be expressed throughout adult hood as well selective mutism is characterized by a consistent failure to speak in social situations in which there is an expectation to speak eg school even though the individual speaks in other situations the failure to speak has significant consequences on achievement in aca demic or occupational settings or otherwise interferes with normal social communication individuals with specific phobia are fearful or anxious about or avoidant of circum scribed objects or situations a specific cognitive ideation is not featured in this disorder as it is in other anxiety disorders the fear anxiety or avoidance is almost always imme 190 anxiety disorders diately induced by the phobic situation to a degree that is persistent and out of proportion to the actual risk posed there are various types of specific phobias animal natural envi ronment bloodinjectioninjury situational and other situations in social anxiety disorder social phobia the individual is fearful or anxious about or avoidant of social interactions and situations that involve the possibility of being scruti nized these include social interactions such as meeting unfamiliar people situations in which the individual may be observed eating or drinking and situations in which the in dividual performs in front of others the cognitive ideation is of being negatively evalu ated by others by being embarrassed humiliated or rejected or offending others in panic disorder the individual experiences recurrent unexpected panic attacks and is persistently concerned or worried about having more panic attacks or changes his or her behavior in maladaptive ways because of the panic attacks eg avoidance of exercise or of unfamiliar locations panic attacks are abrupt surges of intense fear or intense discomfort that reach a peak within minutes accompanied by physical andor cognitive symptoms limitedsymptom panic attacks include fewer than four symptoms panic attacks may be expected such as in response to a typically feared object or situation or unexpected meaning that the panic attack occurs for no apparent reason panic attacks function as a marker and prognostic factor for severity of diagnosis course and comorbidity across an array of dis orders including but not limited to the anxiety disorders eg substance use depressive and psychotic disorders panic attack may therefore be used as a descriptive specifier for any anxiety disorder as well as other mental disorders individuals with agoraphobia are fearful and anxious about two or more of the follow ing situations using public transportation being in open spaces being in enclosed places standing in line or being in a crowd or being outside of the home alone in other situations the individual fears these situations because of thoughts that escape might be difficult or help might not be available in the event of developing paniclike symptoms or other inca pacitating or embarrassing symptoms these situations almost always induce fear or anx iety and are often avoided and require the presence of a companion the key features of generalized anxiety disorder are persistent and excessive anxiety and worry about various domains including work and school performance that the indi vidual finds difficult to control in addition the individual experiences physical symptoms including restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge being easily fatigued difficulty con centrating or mind going blank irritability muscle tension and sleep disturbance substancemedicationinduced anxiety disorder involves anxiety due to substance in toxication or withdrawal or to a medication treatment in anxiety disorder due to another medical condition anxiety symptoms are the physiological consequence of another med ical condition disorderspecific scales are available to better characterize the severity of each anxiety disorder and to capture change in severity over time for ease of use particularly for in dividuals with more than one anxiety disorder these scales have been developed to have the same format but different focus across the anxiety disorders with ratings of behav ioral symptoms cognitive ideation symptoms and physical symptoms relevant to each disorder",
    "separation anxiety disorder": "a developmentally inappropriate and excessive fear or anxiety concerning separation from those to whom the individual is attached as evidenced by at least three of the following 1 recurrent excessive distress when anticipating or experiencing separation from home or from major attachment figures"
