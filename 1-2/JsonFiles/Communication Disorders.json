    "global developmental delay": "this diagnosis is reserved for individuals under the age of 5 years when the clinical severity level cannot be reliably assessed during early childhood this category is diagnosed when an individual fails to meet expected developmental milestones in several areas of intellec tual functioning and applies to individuals who are unable to undergo systematic assess ments of intellectual functioning including children who are too young to participate in standardized testing this category requires reassessment after a period of time",
    "intellectual developmental disorder": "this category is reserved for individuals over the age of 5 years when assessment of the degree of intellectual disability intellectual developmental disorder by means of locally available procedures is rendered difficult or impossible because of associated sensory or physical impairments as in blindness or prelingual deafness locomotor disability or pres ence of severe problem behaviors or cooccurring mental disorder this category should only be used in exceptional circumstances and requires reassessment after a period of time",

    "language disorder": "language disorder is strongly associated with other neurodevelopmental disorders in terms of specific learning disorder literacy and numeracy attentiondeficithyperactiv ity disorder autism spectrum disorder and developmental coordination disorder it is also associated with social pragmatic communication disorder a positive family history of speech or language disorders is often present",
    "speech sound disorder": "normal variations in speech regional social or culturalethnic variations of speech should be considered before making the diagnosis hearing or other sensory impairment hearing impairment or deafness may result in abnormalities of speech deficits of speech sound production may be associated with a hearing impairment other sensory deficit or a speechmotor deficit when speech deficits are in excess of those usually associated with these problems a diagnosis of speech sound disorder may be made structural deficits speech impairment may be due to structural deficits eg cleft palate dysarthria speech impairment may be attributable to a motor disorder such as cerebral palsy neurological signs as well as distinctive features of voice differentiate dysarthria from speech sound disorder although in young children under 3 years differentiation may be difficult particularly when there is no or minimal general body motor involve ment as in eg worsterdrought syndrome selective mutism limited use of speech may be a sign of selective mutism an anxiety disorder that is characterized by a lack of speech in one or more contexts or settings se lective mutism may develop in children with a speech disorder because of embarassment about their impairments but many children with selective mutism exhibit normal speech in safe settings such as at home or with close friends",
    "childhoodonset fluency disorder stuttering": "sensory deficits dysfluencies of speech may be associated with a hearing impairment or other sensory deficit or a speechmotor deficit when the speech dysfluencies are in ex cess of those usually associated with these problems a diagnosis of childhoodonset flu ency disorder may be made normal speech dysfluencies the disorder must be distinguished from normal dysflu encies that occur frequently in young children which include wholeword or phrase rep etitions eg i want i want ice cream incomplete phrases interjections unfilled pauses and parenthetical remarks if these difficulties increase in frequency or complexity as the child grows older a diagnosis of childhoodonset fluency disorder is appropriate medication side effects stuttering may occur as a side effect of medication and may be detected by a temporal relationship with exposure to the medication adultonset dysfluencies if onset of dysfluencies is during or after adolescence it is an adultonset dysfluency rather than a neurodevelopmental disorder adultonset dysflu encies are associated with specific neurological insults and a variety of medical conditions and mental disorders and may be specified with them but they are not a dsm5 diagnosis tourettes disorder vocal tics and repetitive vocalizations of tourettes disorder should be distinguishable from the repetitive sounds of childhoodonset fluency disorder by their nature and timing",
    "social pragmatic communication disorder": "autism spectrum disorder autism spectrum disorder is the primary diagnostic con sideration for individuals presenting with social communication deficits the two disor ders can be differentiated by the presence in autism spectrum disorder of restricted repetitive patterns of behavior interests or activities and their absence in social prag matic communication disorder individuals with autism spectrum disorder may only dis play the restrictedrepetitive patterns of behavior interests and activities during the early developmental period so a comprehensive history should be obtained current absence of symptoms would not preclude a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder if the restricted interests and repetitive behaviors were present in the past a diagnosis of social prag matic communication disorder should be considered only if the developmental history fails to reveal any evidence of restrictedrepetitive patterns of behavior interests or ac tivities attentiondeficithyperactivity disorder primary deficits of adhd may cause impair ments in social communication and functional limitations of effective communication so cial participation or academic achievement social anxiety disorder social phobia the symptoms of social communication disor der overlap with those of social anxiety disorder the differentiating feature is the timing of the onset of symptoms in social pragmatic communication disorder the individual has never had effective social communication in social anxiety disorder the social com munication skills developed appropriately but are not utilized because of anxiety fear or distress about social interactions intellectual disability intellectual developmental disorder and global developmental delay social communication skills may be deficient among individuals with global de velopmental delay or intellectual disability but a separate diagnosis is not given unless the social communication deficits are clearly in excess of the intellectual limitations",
    "unspecified communication disorder": "this category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of communication disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social occupational or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for com munication disorder or for any of the disorders in the neurodevelopmental disorders diag nostic class the unspecified communication disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for com munication disorder or for a specific neurodevelopmental disorder and includes presen tations in which there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis"
