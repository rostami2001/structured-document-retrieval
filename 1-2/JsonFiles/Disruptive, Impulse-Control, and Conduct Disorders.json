    "and conduct disorders": "ing problems in the selfcontrol of emotions and behaviors while other disorders in dsm 5 may also involve problems in emotional andor behavioral regulation the disorders in this chapter are unique in that these problems are manifested in behaviors that violate the rights of others eg aggression destruction of property andor that bring the individual into significant conflict with societal norms or authority figures the underlying causes of the problems in the selfcontrol of emotions and behaviors can vary greatly across the dis orders in this chapter and among individuals within a given diagnostic category the chapter includes oppositional defiant disorder intermittent explosive disorder con duct disorder antisocial personality disorder which is described in the chapter personality disorders pyromania kleptomania and other specified and unspecified disruptive im pulsecontrol and conduct disorders although all the disorders in the chapter involve problems in both emotional and behavioral regulation the source of variation among the disorders is the relative emphasis on problems in the two types of selfcontrol for example the criteria for conduct disorder focus largely on poorly controlled behaviors that violate the rights of others or that violate major societal norms many of the behavioral symptoms eg aggression can be a result of poorly controlled emotions such as anger at the other extreme the criteria for intermittent explosive disorder focus largely on such poorly controlled emo tion outbursts of anger that are disproportionate to the interpersonal or other provocation or to other psychosocial stressors intermediate in impact to these two disorders is opposi tional defiant disorder in which the criteria are more evenly distributed between emotions anger and irritation and behaviors argumentativeness and defiance pyromania and kleptomania are less commonly used diagnoses characterized by poor impulse control re lated to specific behaviors fire setting or stealing that relieve internal tension other speci fied disruptive impulsecontrol and conduct disorder is a category for conditions in which there are symptoms of conduct disorder oppositional defiant disorder or other disruptive impulsecontrol and conduct disorders but the number of symptoms does not meet the di agnostic threshold for any of the disorders in this chapter even though there is evidence of clinically significant impairment associated with the symptoms the disruptive impulsecontrol and conduct disorders all tend to be more common in males than in females although the relative degree of male predominance may differ both across disorders and within a disorder at different ages the disorders in this chapter tend to have first onset in childhood or adolescence in fact it is very rare for either conduct disorder or oppositional defiant disorder to first emerge in adulthood there is a developmental relation ship between oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder in that most cases of con duct disorder previously would have met criteria for oppositional defiant disorder at least in those cases in which conduct disorder emerges prior to adolescence however most children with oppositional defiant disorder do not eventually develop conduct disorder furthermore children with oppositional defiant disorder are at risk for eventually developing other prob lems besides conduct disorder including anxiety and depressive disorders many of the symptoms that define the disruptive impulsecontrol and conduct disor ders are behaviors that can occur to some degree in typically developing individuals thus it is critical that the frequency persistence pervasiveness across situations and im 462 disruptive impulsecontrol and conduct disorders pairment associated with the behaviors indicative of the diagnosis be considered relative to what is normative for a persons age gender and culture when determining if they are symptomatic of a disorder the disruptive impulsecontrol and conduct disorders have been linked to a common externalizing spectrum associated with the personality dimensions labeled as disinhibition and inversely constraint and to a lesser extent negative emotionality these shared per sonality dimensions could account for the high level of comorbidity among these disorders and their frequent comorbidity with substance use disorders and antisocial personality disorder however the specific nature of the shared diathesis that constitutes the exter nalizing spectrum remains unknown",
