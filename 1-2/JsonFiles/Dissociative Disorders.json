dissociative disorder dissociative symptoms are experienced as a unbidden intrusions into awareness and behavior with accompanying losses of continuity in subjective experience ie positive dissociative symptoms such as fragmentation of identity depersonalization and dereal ization andor b inability to access information or to control mental functions that nor mally are readily amenable to access or control ie negative dissociative symptoms such as amnesia the dissociative disorders are frequently found in the aftermath of trauma and many of the symptoms including embarrassment and confusion about the symptoms or a desire to hide them are influenced by the proximity to trauma in dsm5 the dissociative disor ders are placed next to but are not part of the trauma and stressorrelated disorders re flecting the close relationship between these diagnostic classes both acute stress disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder contain dissociative symptoms such as amnesia flash backs numbing and depersonalizationderealization depersonalizationderealization disorder is characterized by clinically significant persis tent or recurrent depersonalization ie experiences of unreality or detachment from ones mind self or body andor derealization ie experiences of unreality or detachment from ones surroundings these alterations of experience are accompanied by intact reality testing there is no evidence of any distinction between individuals with predominantly depersonalization versus derealization symptoms therefore individuals with this disor der can have depersonalization derealization or both dissociative amnesia is characterized by an inability to recall autobiographical informa tion this amnesia may be localized ie an event or period of time selective ie a specific aspect of an event or generalized ie identity and life history dissociative amnesia is fun damentally an inability to recall autobiographical information that is inconsistent with nor mal forgetting it may or may not involve purposeful travel or bewildered wandering ie fugue although some individuals with amnesia promptly notice that they have lost time or that they have a gap in their memory most individuals with dissociative disorders are ini tially unaware of their amnesias for them awareness of amnesia occurs only when personal identity is lost or when circumstances make these individuals aware that autobiographical information is missing eg when they discover evidence of events they cannot recall or when others tell them or ask them about events they cannot recall until and unless this hap pens these individuals have amnesia for their amnesia amnesia is experienced as an es sential feature of dissociative amnesia individuals may experience localized or selective amnesia most commonly or generalized amnesia rarely dissociative fugue is rare in per sons with dissociative amnesia but common in dissociative identity disorder dissociative identity
