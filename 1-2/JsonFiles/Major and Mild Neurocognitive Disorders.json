    "other specified delirium": "this category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of delirium that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social occupational or other impor tant areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for delirium or any of the disorders in the neurocognitive disorders diagnostic class the other specified delirium category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for delirium or any specific neuro cognitive disorder this is done by recording other specified delirium followed by the spe cific reason eg attenuated delirium syndrome an example of a presentation that can be specified using the other specified desig nation is the following attenuated delirium syndrome this syndrome applies in cases of delirium in which the severity of cognitive impairment falls short of that required for the diagnosis or in which some but not all diagnostic criteria for delirium are met",
    "unspecified delirium": "this category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of delirium that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social occupational or other impor tant areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for delirium or any of the disorders in the neurocognitive disorders diagnostic class the unspecified delirium category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for delirium and includes presentations for which there is insuffi cient information to make a more specific diagnosis eg in emergency room settings",

    "mild neurocognitive disorder": "ncds are common in older individuals and thus often cooccur with a wide variety of age related diseases that may complicate diagnosis or treatment most notable of these is delirium for which ncd increases the risk in older individuals a delirium during hos pitalization is in many cases the first time that an ncd is noticed although a careful his tory will often reveal evidence of earlier decline mixed ncds are also common in older individuals as many etiological entities increase in prevalence with age in younger indi viduals ncd often cooccurs with neurodevelopmental disorders for example a head in major or mild neurocognitive disorder due to alzheimers disease 611 jury in a preschool child may also lead to significant developmental and learning issues additional comorbidity of ncd is often related to the etiological subtype as discussed in the relevant sections",
