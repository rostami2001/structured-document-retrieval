    "neurocognitive disorder": "other neurocognitive disorders other neurodegenerative diseases may be distinguished from major or mild frontotemporal ncd by their characteristic features in major or mild ncd due to alzheimers disease decline in learning and memory is an early feature however 1030 of patients presenting with a syndrome suggestive of major or mild frontotemporal ncd are found at autopsy to have alzheimers disease pathology this oc curs more frequently in individuals who present with progressive dysexecutive syn dromes in the absence of behavioral changes or movement disorder or in those with the logopenic variant in major or mild ncd with lewy bodies core and suggestive features of lewy bodies must be present in major or mild ncd due to parkinsons disease spontaneous parkin sonism emerges well before the cognitive decline in major or mild vascular ncd depend ing on affected brain regions there may also be loss of executive ability and behavioral changes such as apathy and this disorder should be considered in the differential diagno sis however history of a cerebrovascular event is temporally related to the onset of cog nitive impairment in major or mild vascular ncd and neuroimaging reveals infarctions or white matter lesions sufficient to account for the clinical picture other neurological conditions major or mild frontotemporal ncd overlaps with pro gressive supranuclear palsy corticobasal degeneration and motor neuron disease clinically as well as pathologically progressive supranuclear palsy is characterized by 618 neurocognitive disorders supranuclear gaze palsies and axialpredominant parkinsonism pseudobulbar signs may be present and retropulsion is often prominent neurocognitive assessment shows psy chomotor slowing poor working memory and executive dysfunction corticobasal degen eration presents with asymmetric rigidity limb apraxia postural instability myoclonus alien limb phenomenon and cortical sensory loss many individuals with behavioralvariant major or mild frontotemporal ncd show features of motor neuron disease which tend to be mixed upper and predominantly lower motor neuron disease other mental disorders and medical conditions behavioralvariant major or mild fron totemporal ncd may be mistaken for a primary mental disorder such as major depression bipolar disorders or schizophrenia and individuals with this variant often present initially to psychiatry over time the development of progressive neurocognitive difficulties will help to make the distinction a careful medical evaluation will help to exclude treatable causes of ncds such as metabolic disturbances nutritional deficiencies and infections",
