    "due to huntingtons disease": "other mental disorders early symptoms of huntingtons disease may include instabil ity of mood irritability or compulsive behaviors that may suggest another mental disor der however genetic testing or the development of motor symptoms will distinguish the presence of huntingtons disease other neurocognitive disorders the early symptoms of huntingtons disease particu larly symptoms of executive dysfunction and impaired psychomotor speed may resemble other neurocognitive disorders ncds such as major or mild vascular ncd major or mild neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition 641 other movement disorders huntingtons disease must also be differentiated from other disorders or conditions associated with chorea such as wilsons disease druginduced tardive dyskinesia sydenhams chorea systemic lupus erythematosus or senile chorea rarely individuals may present with a course similar to that of huntingtons disease but without positive genetic testing this is considered to be a huntingtons disease pheno copy that results from a variety of potential genetic factors",
    "due to another medical condition": "a number of other medical conditions can cause neurocognitive disorders ncds these conditions include structural lesions eg primary or secondary brain tumors subdural hematoma slowly progressive or normalpressure hydrocephalus hypoxia related to hy poperfusion from heart failure endocrine conditions eg hypothyroidism hypercalce mia hypoglycemia nutritional conditions eg deficiencies of thiamine or niacin other infectious conditions eg neurosyphilis cryptococcosis immune disorders eg tempo ral arteritis systemic lupus erythematosus hepatic or renal failure metabolic conditions eg kufs disease adrenoleukodystrophy metachromatic leukodystrophy other storage diseases of adulthood and childhood and other neurological conditions eg epilepsy multiple sclerosis unusual causes of central nervous system injury such as electrical shock or intracranial radiation are generally evident from the history the temporal asso ciation between the onset or exacerbation of the medical condition and the development of the cognitive deficit offers the greatest support that the ncd is induced by the medical condition diagnostic certainty regarding this relationship may be increased if the neuro cognitive deficits ameliorate partially or stabilize in the context of treatment of the medical condition"
