    "due to multiple etiologies": "a the criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder b there is evidence from the history physical examination or laboratory findings that the neurocognitive disorder is the pathophysiological consequence of more than one etio logical process excluding substances eg neurocognitive disorder due to alzhei mers disease with subsequent development of vascular neurocognitive disorder note please refer to the diagnostic criteria for the various neurocognitive disorders due to specific medical conditions for guidance on establishing the particular etiologies c the cognitive deficits are not better explained by another mental disorder and do not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium coding note for major neurocognitive disorder due to multiple etiologies with behavioral disturbance code 29411 f0281 for major neurocognitive disorder due to multiple etiolo gies without behavioral disturbance code 29410 f0280 all of the etiological medical conditions with the exception of vascular disease should be coded and listed separately immediately before major neurocognitive disorder due to multiple etiologies eg 3310 g309 alzheimers disease 33182 g3183 lewy body disease 29411 f0281 major neurocognitive disorder due to multiple etiologies with behavioral disturbance when a cerebrovascular etiology is contributing to the neurocognitive disorder the diagno sis of vascular neurocognitive disorder should be listed in addition to major neurocognitive disorder due to multiple etiologies for example for a presentation of major neurocognitive disorder due to both alzheimers disease and vascular disease with behavioral disturbance code the following 3310 g309 alzheimers disease 29411 f0281 major neurocogni tive disorder due to multiple etiologies with behavioral disturbance 29040 f0151 major vascular neurocognitive disorder with behavioral disturbance for mild neurocognitive disorder due to multiple etiologies code 33183 g3184 note do not use the additional codes for the etiologies behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be indicated in writing unspecified neurocognitive disorder 643 this category is included to cover the clinical presentation of a neurocognitive disorder ncd for which there is evidence that multiple medical conditions have played a probable role in the development of the ncd in addition to evidence indicative of the presence of multiple med ical conditions that are known to cause ncd ie findings from the history and physical ex amination and laboratory findings it may be helpful to refer to the diagnostic criteria and text for the various medical etiologies eg ncd due to parkinsons disease for more information on establishing the etiological connection for that particular medical condition",
    "unspecified neurocognitive disorder": "this category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a neurocogni tive disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social occupational or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the neurocognitive disorders diagnostic class the unspecified neuro cognitive disorder category is used in situations in which the precise etiology cannot be determined with sufficient certainty to make an etiological attribution coding note for unspecified major or mild neurocognitive disorder code 79959 r419 note do not use additional codes for any presumed etiological medical conditions be havioral disturbance cannot be coded but may be indicated in writing"
