    "effects of medication": "their frequent importance in 1 the management by medication of mental disorders or oth er medical conditions and 2 the differential diagnosis of mental disorders eg anxiety disorder versus neurolepticinduced akathisia malignant catatonia versus neuroleptic malignant syndrome although these movement disorders are labeled medication in duced it is often difficult to establish the causal relationship between medication expo sure and the development of the movement disorder especially because some of these movement disorders also occur in the absence of medication exposure the conditions and problems listed in this chapter are not mental disorders the term neuroleptic is becoming outdated because it highlights the propensity of an tipsychotic medications to cause abnormal movements and it is being replaced with the term antipsychotic in many contexts nevertheless the term neuroleptic remains appropri ate in this context although newer antipsychotic medications may be less likely to cause some medicationinduced movement disorders those disorders still occur neuroleptic medications include socalled conventional typical or firstgeneration antipsychotic agents eg chlorpromazine haloperidol fluphenazine atypical or secondgeneration antipsychotic agents eg clozapine risperidone olanzapine quetiapine certain dopa mine receptorblocking drugs used in the treatment of symptoms such as nausea and gas troparesis eg prochlorperazine promethazine trimethobenzamide thiethylperazine metoclopramide and amoxapine which is marketed as an antidepressant",

    "neuroleptic malignant syndrome": "neuroleptic malignant syndrome must be distinguished from other serious neurological or medical conditions including central nervous system infections inflammatory or au toimmune conditions status epilepticus subcortical structural lesions and systemic con ditions eg pheochromocytoma thyrotoxicosis tetanus heat stroke neuroleptic malignant syndrome also must be distinguished from similar syndromes resulting from the use of other substances or medications such as serotonin syndrome parkinsonian hyperthermia syndrome following abrupt discontinuation of dopamine ag onists alcohol or sedative withdrawal malignant hyperthermia occurring during anes thesia hyperthermia associated with abuse of stimulants and hallucinogens and atropine poisoning from anticholinergics in rare instances individuals with schizophrenia or a mood disorder may present with malignant catatonia which may be indistinguishable from neuroleptic malignant syn drome some investigators consider neuroleptic malignant syndrome to be a drug induced form of malignant catatonia",
    "medicationinduced acute dystonia": "33372 g2402 medicationinduced acute dystonia abnormal and prolonged contraction of the muscles of the eyes oculogyric crisis head neck torticollis or retrocollis limbs or trunk developing within a few days of starting or raising the dosage of a medication such as a neuroleptic or after reducing the dosage of a medication used to treat extrapyramidal symptoms",
    "medicationinduced acute akathisia": "33399 g2571 medicationinduced acute akathisia subjective complaints of restlessness often accompanied by observed excessive move ments eg fidgety movements of the legs rocking from foot to foot pacing inability to sit or stand still developing within a few weeks of starting or raising the dosage of a medi cation such as a neuroleptic or after reducing the dosage of a medication used to treat ex trapyramidal symptoms 712 medicationinduced movement disorders",
    "tardive dyskinesia": "33385 g2401 tardive dyskinesia involuntary athetoid or choreiform movements lasting at least a few weeks generally of the tongue lower face and jaw and extremities but sometimes involving the pharyngeal diaphragmatic or trunk muscles developing in association with the use of a neuroleptic medication for at least a few months symptoms may develop after a shorter period of medication use in older persons in some patients movements of this type may appear after discontinuation or after change or reduction in dosage of neuroleptic medications in which case the condition is called neuroleptic withdrawalemergent dyskinesia because withdrawalemergent dyskinesia is usually timelimited lasting less than 48 weeks dyskinesia that persists beyond this win dow is considered to be tardive dyskinesia",
    "tardive akathisia": "33372 g2409 tardive dystonia 33399 g2571 tardive akathisia tardive syndrome involving other types of movement problems such as dystonia or akathisia which are distinguished by their late emergence in the course of treatment and their potential persistence for months to years even in the face of neuroleptic discontinu ation or dosage reduction",
    "medicationinduced postural tremor": "3331 g251 medicationinduced postural tremor fine tremor usually in the range of 812 hz occurring during attempts to maintain a pos ture and developing in association with the use of medication eg lithium antidepres sants valproate this tremor is very similar to the tremor seen with anxiety caffeine and other stimulants",
    "other medicationinduced movement disorder": "33399 g2579 other medicationinduced movement disorder this category is for medicationinduced movement disorders not captured by any of the specific disorders listed above examples include 1 presentations resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome that are associated with medications other than neuroleptics and 2 other medicationinduced tardive conditions",
    "antidepressant discontinuation syndrome": "typically the individual was initially started on the medication for a major depressive dis order the original symptoms may return during the discontinuation syndrome",
    "other adverse effect of medication": "99520 t50905a initial encounter 99520 t50905d subsequent encounter 99520 t50905s sequelae this category is available for optional use by clinicians to code side effects of medication other than movement symptoms when these adverse effects become a main focus of clin ical attention examples include severe hypotension cardiac arrhythmias and priapism"
