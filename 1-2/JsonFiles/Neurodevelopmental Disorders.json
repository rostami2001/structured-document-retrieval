    "disorders": "developmental period the disorders typically manifest early in development often be fore the child enters grade school and are characterized by developmental deficits that produce impairments of personal social academic or occupational functioning the range of developmental deficits varies from very specific limitations of learning or control of executive functions to global impairments of social skills or intelligence the neurode velopmental disorders frequently cooccur for example individuals with autism spec trum disorder often have intellectual disability intellectual developmental disorder and many children with attentiondeficithyperactivity disorder adhd also have a specific learning disorder for some disorders the clinical presentation includes symptoms of ex cess as well as deficits and delays in achieving expected milestones for example autism spectrum disorder is diagnosed only when the characteristic deficits of social communi cation are accompanied by excessively repetitive behaviors restricted interests and insis tence on sameness intellectual disability intellectual developmental disorder is characterized by deficits in general mental abilities such as reasoning problem solving planning abstract thinking judgment academic learning and learning from experience the deficits result in impair ments of adaptive functioning such that the individual fails to meet standards of personal independence and social responsibility in one or more aspects of daily life including com munication social participation academic or occupational functioning and personal inde pendence at home or in community settings global developmental delay as its name implies is diagnosed when an individual fails to meet expected developmental milestones in several areas of intellectual functioning the diagnosis is used for individuals who are unable to undergo systematic assessments of intellectual functioning including children who are too young to participate in standardized testing intellectual disability may result from an acquired insult during the developmental period from for example a severe head injury in which case a neurocognitive disorder also may be diagnosed the communication disorders include language disorder speech sound disorder so cial pragmatic communication disorder and childhoodonset fluency disorder stutter ing the first three disorders are characterized by deficits in the development and use of language speech and social communication respectively childhoodonset fluency dis order is characterized by disturbances of the normal fluency and motor production of speech including repetitive sounds or syllables prolongation of consonants or vowel sounds broken words blocking or words produced with an excess of physical tension like other neurodevelopmental disorders communication disorders begin early in life and may produce lifelong functional impairments autism spectrum disorder is characterized by persistent deficits in social communica tion and social interaction across multiple contexts including deficits in social reciprocity nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social interaction and skills in developing maintaining and understanding relationships in addition to the social communication deficits the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder requires the presence of restricted re petitive patterns of behavior interests or activities because symptoms change with de velopment and may be masked by compensatory mechanisms the diagnostic criteria may 32 neurodevelopmental disorders be met based on historical information although the current presentation must cause sig nificant impairment within the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder individual clinical characteristics are noted through the use of specifiers with or without accompanying intellectual impair ment with or without accompanying structural language impairment associated with a known medicalgenetic or environmentalacquired condition associated with another neurodevelopmental mental or behavioral disorder as well as specifiers that describe the autistic symptoms age at first concern with or without loss of established skills sever ity these specifiers provide clinicians with an opportunity to individualize the diagnosis and communicate a richer clinical description of the affected individuals for example many individuals previously diagnosed with aspergers disorder would now receive a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder without language or intellectual impairment adhd is a neurodevelopmental disorder defined by impairing levels of inattention dis organization andor hyperactivityimpulsivity inattention and disorganization entail inabil ity to stay on task seeming not to listen and losing materials at levels that are inconsistent with age or developmental level hyperactivityimpulsivity entails overactivity fidgeting in ability to stay seated intruding into other peoples activities and inability to waitsymptoms that are excessive for age or developmental level in childhood adhd frequently overlaps with disorders that are often considered to be externalizing disorders such as oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder adhd often persists into adulthood with resultant impairments of social academic and occupational functioning the neurodevelopmental motor disorders include developmental coordination disor der stereotypic movement disorder and tic disorders developmental coordination dis order is characterized by deficits in the acquisition and execution of coordinated motor skills and is manifested by clumsiness and slowness or inaccuracy of performance of mo tor skills that cause interference with activities of daily living stereotypic movement dis order is diagnosed when an individual has repetitive seemingly driven and apparently purposeless motor behaviors such as hand flapping body rocking head banging self biting or hitting the movements interfere with social academic or other activities if the behaviors cause selfinjury this should be specified as part of the diagnostic description tic disorders are characterized by the presence of motor or vocal tics which are sudden rapid recurrent nonrhythmic sterotyped motor movements or vocalizations the dura tion presumed etiology and clinical presentation define the specific tic disorder that is di agnosed tourettes disorder persistent chronic motor or vocal tic disorder provisional tic disorder other specified tic disorder and unspecified tic disorder tourettes disorder is diagnosed when the individual has multiple motor and vocal tics that have been present for at least 1 year and that have a waxingwaning symptom course specific learning disorder as the name implies is diagnosed when there are specific defi cits in an individuals ability to perceive or process information efficiently and accurately this neurodevelopmental disorder first manifests during the years of formal schooling and is characterized by persistent and impairing difficulties with learning foundational academic skills in reading writing andor math the individuals performance of the affected academic skills is well below average for age or acceptable performance levels are achieved only with extraordinary effort specific learning disorder may occur in individuals identified as intellec tually gifted and manifest only when the learning demands or assessment procedures eg timed tests pose barriers that cannot be overcome by their innate intelligence and compensa tory strategies for all individuals specific learning disorder can produce lifelong impairments in activities dependent on the skills including occupational performance the use of specifiers for the neurodevelopmental disorder diagnoses enriches the clin ical description of the individuals clinical course and current symptomatology in addi tion to specifiers that describe the clinical presentation such as age at onset or severity ratings the neurodevelopmental disorders may include the specifier associated with a known medical or genetic condition or environmental factor this specifier gives clini intellectual disability intellectual developmental disorder 33 cians an opportunity to document factors that may have played a role in the etiology of the disorder as well as those that might affect the clinical course examples include genetic disorders such as fragile x syndrome tuberous sclerosis and rett syndrome medical con ditions such as epilepsy and environmental factors including very low birth weight and fetal alcohol exposure even in the absence of stigmata of fetal alcohol syndrome",
    "intellectual developmental disorder": "the various levels of severity are defined on the basis of adaptive functioning and not iq scores because it is adaptive functioning that determines the level of supports required moreover iq measures are less valid in the lower end of the iq range"
