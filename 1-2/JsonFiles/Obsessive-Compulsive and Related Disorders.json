to one another in terms of a range of diagnostic validators as well as the clinical utility of grouping these disorders in the same chapter clinicians are encouraged to screen for these conditions in individuals who present with one of them and be aware of overlaps between these conditions at the same time there are important differences in diagnostic validators and treatment ap proaches across these disorders moreover there are close relationships between the anx iety disorders and some of the obsessivecompulsive and related disorders eg ocd which is reflected in the sequence of dsm5 chapters with obsessivecompulsive and re lated disorders following anxiety disorders the obsessivecompulsive and related disorders differ from developmentally norma tive preoccupations and rituals by being excessive or persisting beyond developmentally appropriate periods the distinction between the presence of subclinical symptoms and a clinical disorder requires assessment of a number of factors including the individuals level of distress and impairment in functioning the chapter begins with ocd it then covers body dysmorphic disorder and hoarding disorder which are characterized by cognitive symptoms such as perceived defects or flaws in physical appearance or the perceived need to save possessions respectively the chapter then covers trichotillomania hairpulling disorder and excoriation skinpicking disorder which are characterized by recurrent bodyfocused repetitive behaviors finally it covers substancemedicationinduced obsessivecompulsive and related disorder obsessivecompulsive and

character ized by the belief that ones body build is too small or is insufficiently muscular hoarding disorder is characterized by persistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions regardless of their actual value as a result of a strong perceived need to save the items and to distress associated with discarding them hoarding disorder differs from normal collecting for example symptoms of hoarding disorder result in the accumula tion of a large number of possessions that congest and clutter active living areas to the ex tent that their intended use is substantially compromised the excessive acquisition form of hoarding disorder which characterizes most but not all individuals with hoarding dis order consists of excessive collecting buying or stealing of items that are not needed or for which there is no available space trichotillomania hairpulling disorder is characterized by recurrent pulling out of ones hair resulting in hair loss and repeated attempts to decrease or stop hair pulling excoriation skinpicking disorder is characterized by recurrent picking of ones skin re sulting in skin lesions and repeated attempts to decrease or stop skin picking the body focused repetitive behaviors that characterize these two disorders are not triggered by ob sessions or preoccupations however they may be preceded or accompanied by various emotional states such as feelings of anxiety or boredom they may also be preceded by an increasing sense of tension or may lead to gratification pleasure or a sense of relief when the hair is pulled out or the skin is picked individuals with these disorders may have vary ing degrees of conscious awareness of the behavior while engaging in it with some indi viduals displaying more focused attention on the behavior with preceding tension and subsequent relief and other individuals displaying more automatic behavior with the be haviors seeming to occur without full awareness substancemedicationinduced
