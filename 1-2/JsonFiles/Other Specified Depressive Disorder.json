    "other specified depressive disorder": "this category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a depressive disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social occupational or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the depressive disorders diagnostic class the other specified depressive disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific depressive disorder this is done by recording other specified depressive disorder followed by the specific reason eg shortduration depressive episode examples of presentations that can be specified using the other specified designation include the following 1 recurrent brief depression concurrent presence of depressed mood and at least four other symptoms of depression for 213 days at least once per month not associ ated with the menstrual cycle for at least 12 consecutive months in an individual whose presentation has never met criteria for any other depressive or bipolar disorder and does not currently meet active or residual criteria for any psychotic disorder 2 shortduration depressive episode 413 days depressed affect and at least four of the other eight symptoms of a major depressive episode associated with clinically significant distress or impairment that persists for more than 4 days but less than 14 days in an individual whose presentation has never met criteria for any other depressive or bipolar disorder does not currently meet active or residual criteria for any psychotic dis order and does not meet criteria for recurrent brief depression 3 depressive episode with insufficient symptoms depressed affect and at least one of the other eight symptoms of a major depressive episode associated with clinically 184 depressive disorders significant distress or impairment that persist for at least 2 weeks in an individual whose presentation has never met criteria for any other depressive or bipolar disorder does not currently meet active or residual criteria for any psychotic disorder and does not meet criteria for mixed anxiety and depressive disorder symptoms",
    "unspecified depressive disorder": "this category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a depressive dis order that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social occupational or other im portant areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the depressive disorders diagnostic class the unspecified depressive disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific depressive disorder and includes presentations for which there is insuf ficient information to make a more specific diagnosis eg in emergency room settings",
    "specifiers for depressive disorders": "specify if with anxious distress anxious distress is defined as the presence of at least two of the following symptoms during the majority of days of a major depressive episode or persistent depressive disorder dysthymia 1 feeling keyed up or tense 2 feeling unusually restless 3 difficulty concentrating because of worry 4 fear that something awful may happen 5 feeling that the individual might lose control of himself or herself specify current severity mild two symptoms moderate three symptoms moderatesevere four or five symptoms severe four or five symptoms and with motor agitation note anxious distress has been noted as a prominent feature of both bipolar and ma jor depressive disorder in both primary care and specialty mental health settings high levels of anxiety have been associated with higher suicide risk longer duration of ill ness and greater likelihood of treatment nonresponse as a result it is clinically useful to specify accurately the presence and severity levels of anxious distress for treatment planning and monitoring of response to treatment with mixed features a at least three of the following manichypomanic symptoms are present nearly every day during the majority of days of a major depressive episode 1 elevated expansive mood 2 inflated selfesteem or grandiosity 3 more talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking 4 flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing 5 increase in energy or goaldirected activity either socially at work or school or sexually specifiers for depressive disorders 185 6 increased or excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences eg engaging in unrestrained buying sprees sexual in discretions foolish business investments 7 decreased need for sleep feeling rested despite sleeping less than usual to be contrasted with insomnia b mixed symptoms are observable by others and represent a change from the per sons usual behavior c for individuals whose symptoms meet full criteria for either mania or hypomania the diagnosis should be bipolar i or bipolar ii disorder d the mixed symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance eg a drug of abuse a medication or other treatment note mixed features associated with a major depressive episode have been found to be a significant risk factor for the development of bipolar i or bipolar ii disorder as a result it is clinically useful to note the presence of this specifier for treatment planning and monitoring of response to treatment with melancholic features a one of the following is present during the most severe period of the current epi sode 1 loss of pleasure in all or almost all activities 2 lack of reactivity to usually pleasurable stimuli does not feel much better even temporarily when something good happens b three or more of the following 1 a distinct quality of depressed mood characterized by profound despondency despair andor moroseness or by socalled empty mood 2 depression that is regularly worse in the morning 3 earlymorning awakening ie at least 2 hours before usual awakening 4 marked psychomotor agitation or retardation 5 significant anorexia or weight loss 6 excessive or inappropriate guilt note the specifier with melancholic features is applied if these features are present at the most severe stage of the episode there is a nearcomplete absence of the ca pacity for pleasure not merely a diminution a guideline for evaluating the lack of reac tivity of mood is that even highly desired events are not associated with marked brightening of mood either mood does not brighten at all or it brightens only partially eg up to 2040 of normal for only minutes at a time the distinct quality of mood that is characteristic of the with melancholic features specifier is experienced as qual itatively different from that during a nonmelancholic depressive episode a depressed mood that is described as merely more severe longer lasting or present without a rea son is not considered distinct in quality psychomotor changes are nearly always pres ent and are observable by others melancholic features exhibit only a modest tendency to repeat across episodes in the same individual they are more frequent in inpatients as opposed to outpatients are less likely to occur in milder than in more severe major depressive episodes and are more likely to occur in those with psychotic features with atypical features this specifier can be applied when these features predomi nate during the majority of days of the current or most recent major depressive episode or persistent depressive disorder a mood reactivity ie mood brightens in response to actual or potential positive events 186 depressive disorders b two or more of the following 1 significant weight gain or increase in appetite 2 hypersomnia 3 leaden paralysis ie heavy leaden feelings in arms or legs 4 a longstanding pattern of interpersonal rejection sensitivity not limited to epi sodes of mood disturbance that results in significant social or occupational im pairment c criteria are not met for with melancholic features or with catatonia during the same episode note atypical depression has historical significance ie atypical in contradistinction to the more classical agitated endogenous presentations of depression that were the norm when depression was rarely diagnosed in outpatients and almost never in ado lescents or younger adults and today does not connote an uncommon or unusual clin ical presentation as the term might imply mood reactivity is the capacity to be cheered up when presented with positive events eg a visit from children compliments from others mood may become euthymic not sad even for extended periods of time if the external circumstances remain favorable increased appetite may be manifested by an obvious increase in food intake or by weight gain hypersomnia may include either an extended period of nighttime sleep or daytime napping that totals at least 10 hours of sleep per day or at least 2 hours more than when not depressed leaden paralysis is defined as feeling heavy leaden or weighted down usually in the arms or legs this sensation is generally present for at least an hour a day but often lasts for many hours at a time unlike the other atypical features pathological sensitivity to perceived interpersonal rejection is a trait that has an early onset and persists throughout most of adult life rejection sensitivity occurs both when the person is and is not depressed though it may be exacerbated during depressive periods with psychotic features delusions andor hallucinations are present with moodcongruent psychotic features the content of all delusions and hal lucinations is consistent with the typical depressive themes of personal inade quacy guilt disease death nihilism or deserved punishment with moodincongruent psychotic features the content of the delusions or hal lucinations does not involve typical depressive themes of personal inadequacy guilt disease death nihilism or deserved punishment or the content is a mixture of moodincongruent and moodcongruent themes with catatonia the catatonia specifier can apply to an episode of depression if cata tonic features are present during most of the episode see criteria for catatonia asso ciated with a mental disorder for a description of catatonia see the chapter schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders with peripartum onset this specifier can be applied to the current or if full criteria are not currently met for a major depressive episode most recent episode of major de pression if onset of mood symptoms occurs during pregnancy or in the 4 weeks follow ing delivery note mood episodes can have their onset either during pregnancy or postpartum although the estimates differ according to the period of followup after delivery be tween 3 and 6 of women will experience the onset of a major depressive epi sode during pregnancy or in the weeks or months following delivery fifty percent of postpartum major depressive episodes actually begin prior to delivery thus these episodes are referred to collectively as peripartum episodes women with peripartum major depressive episodes often have severe anxiety and even panic specifiers for depressive disorders 187 attacks prospective studies have demonstrated that mood and anxiety symptoms during pregnancy as well as the baby blues increase the risk for a postpartum major depressive episode peripartumonset mood episodes can present either with or without psychotic features infanticide is most often associated with postpartum psychotic episodes that are characterized by command hallucinations to kill the infant or delusions that the infant is possessed but psychotic symptoms can also occur in severe postpar tum mood episodes without such specific delusions or hallucinations postpartum mood major depressive or manic episodes with psychotic features appear to occur in from 1 in 500 to 1 in 1000 deliveries and may be more common in primiparous women the risk of postpartum episodes with psychotic features is particularly increased for women with prior postpartum mood episodes but is also elevated for those with a prior history of a depressive or bipolar disorder especially bipolar i disorder and those with a family history of bipolar disorders once a woman has had a postpartum episode with psychotic features the risk of recurrence with each subsequent delivery is between 30 and 50 postpartum episodes must be differentiated from delirium occurring in the postpartum period which is distinguished by a fluctuating level of awareness or attention the postpar tum period is unique with respect to the degree of neuroendocrine alterations and psychosocial adjustments the potential impact of breastfeeding on treatment planning and the longterm implications of a history of postpartum mood disorder on subsequent family planning with seasonal pattern this specifier applies to recurrent major depressive disorder a there has been a regular temporal relationship between the onset of major depres sive episodes in major depressive disorder and a particular time of the year eg in the fall or winter note do not include cases in which there is an obvious effect of seasonally related psychosocial stressors eg regularly being unemployed every winter b full remissions or a change from major depression to mania or hypomania also occur at a characteristic time of the year eg depression disappears in the spring c in the last 2 years two major depressive episodes have occurred that demonstrate the temporal seasonal relationships defined above and no nonseasonal major de pressive episodes have occurred during that same period d seasonal major depressive episodes as described above substantially outnum ber the nonseasonal major depressive episodes that may have occurred over the individuals lifetime note the specifier with seasonal pattern can be applied to the pattern of major de pressive episodes in major depressive disorder recurrent the essential feature is the onset and remission of major depressive episodes at characteristic times of the year in most cases the episodes begin in fall or winter and remit in spring less commonly there may be recurrent summer depressive episodes this pattern of onset and remis sion of episodes must have occurred during at least a 2year period without any non seasonal episodes occurring during this period in addition the seasonal depressive episodes must substantially outnumber any nonseasonal depressive episodes over the individuals lifetime this specifier does not apply to those situations in which the pattern is better ex plained by seasonally linked psychosocial stressors eg seasonal unemployment or school schedule major depressive episodes that occur in a seasonal pattern are often characterized by prominent energy hypersomnia overeating weight gain and a crav ing for carbohydrates it is unclear whether a seasonal pattern is more likely in recur rent major depressive disorder or in bipolar disorders however within the bipolar disorders group a seasonal pattern appears to be more likely in bipolar ii disorder than 188 depressive disorders in bipolar i disorder in some individuals the onset of manic or hypomanic episodes may also be linked to a particular season the prevalence of wintertype seasonal pattern appears to vary with latitude age and sex prevalence increases with higher latitudes age is also a strong predictor of seasonality with younger persons at higher risk for winter depressive episodes specify if in partial remission symptoms of the immediately previous major depressive episode are present but full criteria are not met or there is a period lasting less than 2 months without any significant symptoms of a major depressive episode following the end of such an episode in full remission during the past 2 months no significant signs or symptoms of the disturbance were present specify current severity severity is based on the number of criterion symptoms the severity of those symptoms and the degree of functional disability mild few if any symptoms in excess of those required to make the diagnosis are present the intensity of the symptoms is distressing but manageable and the symp toms result in minor impairment in social or occupational functioning moderate the number of symptoms intensity of symptoms andor functional impair ment are between those specified for mild and severe severe the number of symptoms is substantially in excess of that required to make the diagnosis the intensity of the symptoms is seriously distressing and unmanage able and the symptoms markedly interfere with social and occupational functioning"
