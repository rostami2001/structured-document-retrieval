    "disorders": "others in private activities exhibitionistic disorder exposing the genitals frotteuristic disorder touching or rubbing against a nonconsenting individual sexual masochism disorder undergoing humiliation bondage or suffering sexual sadism disorder inflict ing humiliation bondage or suffering pedophilic disorder sexual focus on children fe tishistic disorder using nonliving objects or having a highly specific focus on nongenital body parts and transvestic disorder engaging in sexually arousing crossdressing these disorders have traditionally been selected for specific listing and assignment of ex plicit diagnostic criteria in dsm for two main reasons they are relatively common in re lation to other paraphilic disorders and some of them entail actions for their satisfaction that because of their noxiousness or potential harm to others are classed as criminal of fenses the eight listed disorders do not exhaust the list of possible paraphilic disorders many dozens of distinct paraphilias have been identified and named and almost any of them could by virtue of its negative consequences for the individual or for others rise to the level of a paraphilic disorder the diagnoses of the other specified and unspecified paraphilic disorders are therefore indispensable and will be required in many cases in this chapter the order of presentation of the listed paraphilic disorders generally corresponds to common classification schemes for these conditions the first group of disorders is based on anomalous activity preferences these disorders are subdivided into courtship disorders which resemble distorted components of human courtship behavior voyeuristic disorder exhibitionistic disorder and frotteuristic disorder and algolagnic disorders which involve pain and suffering sexual masochism disorder and sexual sadism disorder the second group of disorders is based on anomalous target preferences these disorders include one directed at other humans pedophilic disorder and two directed elsewhere fetishistic disorder and transvestic disorder the term paraphilia denotes any intense and persistent sexual interest other than sexual interest in genital stimulation or preparatory fondling with phenotypically normal phys ically mature consenting human partners in some circumstances the criteria intense and persistent may be difficult to apply such as in the assessment of persons who are very old or medically ill and who may not have intense sexual interests of any kind in such circumstances the term paraphilia may be defined as any sexual interest greater than or equal to normophilic sexual interests there are also specific paraphilias that are gen erally better described as preferential sexual interests than as intense sexual interests some paraphilias primarily concern the individuals erotic activities and others pri marily concern the individuals erotic targets examples of the former would include in tense and persistent interests in spanking whipping cutting binding or strangulating another person or an interest in these activities that equals or exceeds the individuals in terest in copulation or equivalent interaction with another person examples of the latter would include intense or preferential sexual interest in children corpses or amputees as a class as well as intense or preferential interest in nonhuman animals such as horses or dogs or in inanimate objects such as shoes or articles made of rubber a paraphilic disorder is a paraphilia that is currently causing distress or impairment to the individual or a paraphilia whose satisfaction has entailed personal harm or risk of harm to 686 paraphilic disorders others a paraphilia is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for having a paraphilic dis order and a paraphilia by itself does not necessarily justify or require clinical intervention in the diagnostic criteria set for each of the listed paraphilic disorders criterion a specifies the qualitative nature of the paraphilia eg an erotic focus on children or on exposing the gen itals to strangers and criterion b specifies the negative consequences of the paraphilia ie distress impairment or harm to others in keeping with the distinction between paraphilias and paraphilic disorders the term diagnosis should be reserved for individuals who meet both criteria a and b ie individuals who have a paraphilic disorder if an individual meets cri terion a but not criterion b for a particular paraphiliaa circumstance that might arise when a benign paraphilia is discovered during the clinical investigation of some other condition then the individual may be said to have that paraphilia but not a paraphilic disorder it is not rare for an individual to manifest two or more paraphilias in some cases the para philic foci are closely related and the connection between the paraphilias is intuitively com prehensible eg foot fetishism and shoe fetishism in other cases the connection between the paraphilias is not obvious and the presence of multiple paraphilias may be coincidental or else related to some generalized vulnerability to anomalies of psychosexual development in any event comorbid diagnoses of separate paraphilic disorders may be warranted if more than one paraphilia is causing suffering to the individual or harm to others because of the twopronged nature of diagnosing paraphilic disorders clinicianrated or selfrated measures and severity assessments could address either the strength of the paraphilia itself or the seriousness of its consequences although the distress and impair ment stipulated in the criterion b are special in being the immediate or ultimate result of the paraphilia and not primarily the result of some other factor the phenomena of reactive depression anxiety guilt poor work history impaired social relations and so on are not unique in themselves and may be quantified with multipurpose measures of psychosocial functioning or quality of life the most widely applicable framework for assessing the strength of a paraphilia itself is one in which examinees paraphilic sexual fantasies urges or behaviors are evaluated in relation to their normophilic sexual interests and behaviors in a clinical interview or on selfadministered questionnaires examinees can be asked whether their paraphilic sexual fantasies urges or behaviors are weaker than approximately equal to or stronger than their normophilic sexual interests and behaviors this same type of comparison can be and usually is employed in psychophysiological measures of sexual interest such as pe nile plethysmography in males or viewing time in males and females",
    "voyeuristic disorder": "a over a period of at least 6 months recurrent and intense sexual arousal from observ ing an unsuspecting person who is naked in the process of disrobing or engaging in sexual activity as manifested by fantasies urges or behaviors b the individual has acted on these sexual urges with a nonconsenting person or the sexual urges or fantasies cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social occupational or other important areas of functioning c the individual experiencing the arousal andor acting on the urges is at least 18 years of age specify if in a controlled environment this specifier is primarily applicable to individuals living in institutional or other settings where opportunities to engage in voyeuristic behavior are restricted"
