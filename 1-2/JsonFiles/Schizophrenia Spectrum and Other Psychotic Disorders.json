    "disorders in this chapter": "this chapter is organized along a gradient of psychopathology clinicians should first con sider conditions that do not reach full criteria for a psychotic disorder or are limited to one schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders 89 domain of psychopathology then they should consider timelimited conditions finally the diagnosis of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder requires the exclusion of another con dition that may give rise to psychosis schizotypal personality disorder is noted within this chapter as it is considered within the schizophrenia spectrum although its full description is found in the chapter person ality disorders the diagnosis schizotypal personality disorder captures a pervasive pat tern of social and interpersonal deficits including reduced capacity for close relationships cognitive or perceptual distortions and eccentricities of behavior usually beginning by early adulthood but in some cases first becoming apparent in childhood and adolescence abnormalities of beliefs thinking and perception are below the threshold for the diagno sis of a psychotic disorder two conditions are defined by abnormalities limited to one domain of psychosis delu sions or catatonia delusional disorder is characterized by at least 1 month of delusions but no other psychotic symptoms catatonia is described later in the chapter and further in this discussion brief psychotic disorder lasts more than 1 day and remits by 1 month schizophreni form disorder is characterized by a symptomatic presentation equivalent to that of schizo phrenia except for its duration less than 6 months and the absence of a requirement for a decline in functioning schizophrenia lasts for at least 6 months and includes at least 1 month of activephase symptoms in schizoaffective disorder a mood episode and the activephase symptoms of schizophrenia occur together and were preceded or are followed by at least 2 weeks of de lusions or hallucinations without prominent mood symptoms psychotic disorders may be induced by another condition in substancemedication induced psychotic disorder the psychotic symptoms are judged to be a physiological con sequence of a drug of abuse a medication or toxin exposure and cease after removal of the agent in psychotic disorder due to another medical condition the psychotic symptoms are judged to be a direct physiological consequence of another medical condition catatonia can occur in several disorders including neurodevelopmental psychotic bi polar depressive and other mental disorders this chapter also includes the diagnoses catatonia associated with another mental disorder catatonia specifier catatonic disorder due to another medical condition and unspecified catatonia and the diagnostic criteria for all three conditions are described together other specified and unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disor ders are included for classifying psychotic presentations that do not meet the criteria for any of the specific psychotic disorders or psychotic symptomatology about which there is inadequate or contradictory information",
    "related clinical phenomena in psychosis": "psychotic disorders are heterogeneous and the severity of symptoms can predict impor tant aspects of the illness such as the degree of cognitive or neurobiological deficits to move the field forward a detailed framework for the assessment of severity is included in section iii assessment measures which may help with treatment planning prognostic decision making and research on pathophysiological mechanisms section iii assess ment measures also contains dimensional assessments of the primary symptoms of psy chosis including hallucinations delusions disorganized speech except for substance medicationinduced psychotic disorder and psychotic disorder due to another medical condition abnormal psychomotor behavior and negative symptoms as well as dimen sional assessments of depression and mania the severity of mood symptoms in psychosis has prognostic value and guides treatment there is growing evidence that schizoaffective 90 schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders disorder is not a distinct nosological category thus dimensional assessments of depres sion and mania for all psychotic disorders alert clinicians to mood pathology and the need to treat where appropriate the section iii scale also includes a dimensional assessment of cognitive impairment many individuals with psychotic disorders have impairments in a range of cognitive domains that predict functional status clinical neuropsychological as sessment can help guide diagnosis and treatment but brief assessments without formal neuropsychological assessment can provide useful information that can be sufficient for diagnostic purposes formal neuropsychological testing when conducted should be ad ministered and scored by personnel trained in the use of testing instruments if a formal neuropsychological assessment is not conducted the clinician should use the best avail able information to make a judgment further research on these assessments is necessary in order to determine their clinical utility thus the assessments available in section iii should serve as a prototype to stimulate such research",
