    "related disorders": "toms constitute a new category in dsm5 called somatic symptom and related disorders this chapter includes the diagnoses of somatic symptom disorder illness anxiety disorder con version disorder functional neurological symptom disorder psychological factors affect ing other medical conditions factitious disorder other specified somatic symptom and related disorder and unspecified somatic symptom and related disorder all of the disor ders in this chapter share a common feature the prominence of somatic symptoms associ ated with significant distress and impairment individuals with disorders with prominent somatic symptoms are commonly encountered in primary care and other medical settings but are less commonly encountered in psychiatric and other mental health settings these reconceptualized diagnoses based on a reorganization of dsmiv somatoform disorder di agnoses are more useful for primary care and other medical nonpsychiatric clinicians the major diagnosis in this diagnostic class somatic symptom disorder emphasizes diagnosis made on the basis of positive symptoms and signs distressing somatic symp toms plus abnormal thoughts feelings and behaviors in response to these symptoms rather than the absence of a medical explanation for somatic symptoms a distinctive char acteristic of many individuals with somatic symptom disorder is not the somatic symp toms per se but instead the way they present and interpret them incorporating affective cognitive and behavioral components into the criteria for somatic symptom disorder pro vides a more comprehensive and accurate reflection of the true clinical picture than can be achieved by assessing the somatic complaints alone the principles behind the changes in the somatic symptom and related diagnoses from dsmiv are crucial in understanding the dsm5 diagnoses the dsmiv term somatoform disorders was confusing and is replaced by somatic symptom and related disorders in dsmiv there was a great deal of overlap across the somatoform disorders and a lack of clarity about the boundaries of diagnoses although individuals with these disorders primarily present in medical rather than mental health settings nonpsychiatric physicians found the dsmiv somatoform diagnoses difficult to understand and use the current dsm5 clas sification recognizes this overlap by reducing the total number of disorders as well as their subcategories the previous criteria overemphasized the centrality of medically unexplained symptoms such symptoms are present to various degrees particularly in conversion disorder but so matic symptom disorders can also accompany diagnosed medical disorders the reli ability of determining that a somatic symptom is medically unexplained is limited and grounding a diagnosis on the absence of an explanation is problematic and reinforces mindbody dualism it is not appropriate to give an individual a mental disorder diagnosis solely because a medical cause cannot be demonstrated furthermore the presence of a medical diagnosis does not exclude the possibility of a comorbid mental disorder includ ing a somatic symptom and related disorder perhaps because of the predominant focus on lack of medical explanation individuals regarded these diagnoses as pejorative and de meaning implying that their physical symptoms were not real the new classification defines the major diagnosis somatic symptom disorder on the basis of positive symptoms distressing somatic symptoms plus abnormal thoughts feelings and behaviors in response 310 somatic symptom and related disorders to these symptoms however medically unexplained symptoms remain a key feature in conversion disorder and pseudocyesis other specified somatic symptom and related dis order because it is possible to demonstrate definitively in such disorders that the symp toms are not consistent with medical pathophysiology it is important to note that some other mental disorders may initially manifest with pri marily somatic symptoms eg major depressive disorder panic disorder such diagno ses may account for the somatic symptoms or they may occur alongside one of the somatic symptom and related disorders in this chapter there is also considerable medical comor bidity among somatizing individuals although somatic symptoms are frequently associ ated with psychological distress and psychopathology some somatic symptom and related disorders can arise spontaneously and their causes can remain obscure anxiety disorders and depressive disorders may accompany somatic symptom and related disor ders the somatic component adds severity and complexity to depressive and anxiety dis orders and results in higher severity functional impairment and even refractoriness to traditional treatments in rare instances the degree of preoccupation may be so severe as to warrant consideration of a delusional disorder diagnosis a number of factors may contribute to somatic symptom and related disorders these include genetic and biological vulnerability eg increased sensitivity to pain early trau matic experiences eg violence abuse deprivation and learning eg attention ob tained from illness lack of reinforcement of nonsomatic expressions of distress as well as culturalsocial norms that devalue and stigmatize psychological suffering as compared with physical suffering differences in medical care across cultures affect the presentation recognition and management of these somatic presentations variations in symptom pre sentation are likely the result of the interaction of multiple factors within cultural con texts that affect how individuals identify and classify bodily sensations perceive illness and seek medical attention for them thus somatic presentations can be viewed as expres sions of personal suffering inserted in a cultural and social context all of these disorders are characterized by the prominent focus on somatic concerns and their initial presentation mainly in medical rather than mental health care settings so matic symptom disorder offers a more clinically useful method of characterizing individ uals who may have been considered in the past for a diagnosis of somatization disorder furthermore approximately 75 of individuals previously diagnosed with hypochon driasis are subsumed under the diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder however about 25 of individuals with hypochondriasis have high health anxiety in the absence of so matic symptoms and many such individuals symptoms would not qualify for an anxiety disorder diagnosis the dsm5 diagnosis of illness anxiety disorder is for this latter group of individuals illness anxiety disorder can be considered either in this diagnostic section or as an anxiety disorder because of the strong focus on somatic concerns and because ill ness anxiety disorder is most often encountered in medical settings for utility it is listed with the somatic symptom and related disorders in conversion disorder the essential fea ture is neurological symptoms that are found after appropriate neurological assessment to be incompatible with neurological pathophysiology psychological factors affecting other medical conditions is also included in this chapter its essential feature is the pres ence of one or more clinically significant psychological or behavioral factors that adversely affect a medical condition by increasing the risk for suffering death or disability like the other somatic symptom and related disorders factitious disorder embodies persistent problems related to illness perception and identity in the great majority of reported cases of factitious disorder both imposed on self and imposed on another individuals present with somatic symptoms and medical disease conviction consequently dsm5 factitious disorder is included among the somatic symptom and related disorders other specified somatic symptom and related disorder and unspecified somatic symptom and related dis order include conditions for which some but not all of the criteria for somatic symptom disorder or illness anxiety disorder are met as well as pseudocyesis"
