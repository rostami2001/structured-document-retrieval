    "unspecified bipolar and related disorder": "this category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a bipolar and related disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social occupa tional or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the bipolar and related disorders diagnostic class the unspec ified bipolar and related disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician choos es not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific bipolar and related disorder and includes presentations in which there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis eg in emergency room settings",
    "specifiers for bipolar and related disorders": "specify if with anxious distress the presence of at least two of the following symptoms during the majority of days of the current or most recent episode of mania hypomania or de pression 1 feeling keyed up or tense 2 feeling unusually restless 3 difficulty concentrating because of worry 4 fear that something awful may happen 5 feeling that the individual might lose control of himself or herself specify current severity mild two symptoms moderate three symptoms moderatesevere four or five symptoms severe four or five symptoms with motor agitation note anxious distress has been noted as a prominent feature of both bipolar and major depressive disorder in both primary care and specialty mental health set tings high levels of anxiety have been associated with higher suicide risk longer duration of illness and greater likelihood of treatment nonresponse as a result it is clinically useful to specify accurately the presence and severity levels of anxious distress for treatment planning and monitoring of response to treatment with mixed features the mixed features specifier can apply to the current manic hy pomanic or depressive episode in bipolar i or bipolar ii disorder manic or hypomanic episode with mixed features a full criteria are met for a manic episode or hypomanic episode and at least three of the following symptoms are present during the majority of days of the current or most recent episode of mania or hypomania 1 prominent dysphoria or depressed mood as indicated by either subjective report eg feels sad or empty or observation made by others eg ap pears tearful 2 diminished interest or pleasure in all or almost all activities as indicated by either subjective account or observation made by others 3 psychomotor retardation nearly every day observable by others not merely subjective feelings of being slowed down 150 bipolar and related disorders 4 fatigue or loss of energy 5 feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt not merely selfreproach or guilt about being sick 6 recurrent thoughts of death not just fear of dying recurrent suicidal ide ation without a specific plan or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for com mitting suicide b mixed symptoms are observable by others and represent a change from the persons usual behavior c for individuals whose symptoms meet full episode criteria for both mania and depression simultaneously the diagnosis should be manic episode with mixed features due to the marked impairment and clinical severity of full mania d the mixed symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a sub stance eg a drug of abuse a medication other treatment depressive episode with mixed features a full criteria are met for a major depressive episode and at least three of the fol lowing manichypomanic symptoms are present during the majority of days of the current or most recent episode of depression 1 elevated expansive mood 2 inflated selfesteem or grandiosity 3 more talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking 4 flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing 5 increase in energy or goaldirected activity either socially at work or school or sexually 6 increased or excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences eg engaging in unrestrained buying sprees sexual indiscretions or foolish business investments 7 decreased need for sleep feeling rested despite sleeping less than usual to be contrasted with insomnia b mixed symptoms are observable by others and represent a change from the persons usual behavior c for individuals whose symptoms meet full episode criteria for both mania and depression simultaneously the diagnosis should be manic episode with mixed features d the mixed symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a sub stance eg a drug of abuse a medication or other treatment note mixed features associated with a major depressive episode have been found to be a significant risk factor for the development of bipolar i or bipolar ii disorder as a result it is clinically useful to note the presence of this specifier for treatment planning and monitoring of response to treatment with rapid cycling can be applied to bipolar i or bipolar ii disorder presence of at least four mood episodes in the previous 12 months that meet the criteria for manic hypomanic or major depressive episode note episodes are demarcated by either partial or full remissions of at least 2 months or a switch to an episode of the opposite polarity eg major depressive episode to manic episode note the essential feature of a rapidcycling bipolar disorder is the occurrence of at least four mood episodes during the previous 12 months these episodes can occur in any combination and order the episodes must meet both the duration and specifiers for bipolar and related disorders 151 symptom number criteria for a major depressive manic or hypomanic episode and must be demarcated by either a period of full remission or a switch to an episode of the opposite polarity manic and hypomanic episodes are counted as being on the same pole except for the fact that they occur more frequently the episodes that occur in a rapidcycling pattern are no different from those that occur in a nonrapid cycling pattern mood episodes that count toward defining a rapidcycling pattern exclude those episodes directly caused by a substance eg cocaine corticoste roids or another medical condition with melancholic features a one of the following is present during the most severe period of the current episode 1 loss of pleasure in all or almost all activities 2 lack of reactivity to usually pleasurable stimuli does not feel much better even temporarily when something good happens b three or more of the following 1 a distinct quality of depressed mood characterized by profound despondency despair andor moroseness or by socalled empty mood 2 depression that is regularly worse in the morning 3 earlymorning awakening ie at least 2 hours before usual awakening 4 marked psychomotor agitation or retardation 5 significant anorexia or weight loss 6 excessive or inappropriate guilt note the specifier with melancholic features is applied if these features are pres ent at the most severe stage of the episode there is a nearcomplete absence of the capacity for pleasure not merely a diminution a guideline for evaluating the lack of reactivity of mood is that even highly desired events are not associated with marked brightening of mood either mood does not brighten at all or it brightens only partially eg up to 2040 of normal for only minutes at a time the dis tinct quality of mood that is characteristic of the with melancholic features speci fier is experienced as qualitatively different from that during a nonmelancholic depressive episode a depressed mood that is described as merely more severe longer lasting or present without a reason is not considered distinct in quality psy chomotor changes are nearly always present and are observable by others melancholic features exhibit only a modest tendency to repeat across episodes in the same individual they are more frequent in inpatients as opposed to outpa tients are less likely to occur in milder than in more severe major depressive epi sodes and are more likely to occur in those with psychotic features with atypical features this specifier can be applied when these features predomi nate during the majority of days of the current or most recent major depressive epi sode a mood reactivity ie mood brightens in response to actual or potential positive events b two or more of the following features 1 significant weight gain or increase in appetite 2 hypersomnia 3 leaden paralysis ie heavy leaden feelings in arms or legs 4 a longstanding pattern of interpersonal rejection sensitivity not limited to epi sodes of mood disturbance that results in significant social or occupational impairment 152 bipolar and related disorders c criteria are not met for with melancholic features or with catatonia during the same episode note atypical depression has historical significance ie atypical in contradis tinction to the more classical agitated endogenous presentations of depression that were the norm when depression was rarely diagnosed in outpatients and al most never in adolescents or younger adults and today does not connote an un common or unusual clinical presentation as the term might imply mood reactivity is the capacity to be cheered up when presented with positive events eg a visit from children compliments from others mood may become euthymic not sad even for extended periods of time if the external circumstances remain favorable increased appetite may be manifested by an obvious increase in food intake or by weight gain hypersomnia may include either an extended period of nighttime sleep or daytime napping that totals at least 10 hours of sleep per day or at least 2 hours more than when not depressed leaden paralysis is defined as feeling heavy leaden or weighted down usually in the arms or legs this sensation is generally present for at least an hour a day but often lasts for many hours at a time unlike the other atypical features pathological sensitivity to perceived inter personal rejection is a trait that has an early onset and persists throughout most of adult life rejection sensitivity occurs both when the person is and is not depressed though it may be exacerbated during depressive periods with psychotic features delusions or hallucinations are present at any time in the episode if psychotic features are present specify if moodcongruent or moodincon gruent with moodcongruent psychotic features during manic episodes the con tent of all delusions and hallucinations is consistent with the typical manic themes of grandiosity invulnerability etc but may also include themes of sus piciousness or paranoia especially with respect to others doubts about the in dividuals capacities accomplishments and so forth with moodincongruent psychotic features the content of delusions and hallucinations is inconsistent with the episode polarity themes as described above or the content is a mixture of moodincongruent and moodcongruent themes with catatonia this specifier can apply to an episode of mania or depression if cata tonic features are present during most of the episode see criteria for catatonia asso ciated with a mental disorder in the chapter schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders with peripartum onset this specifier can be applied to the current or if the full crite ria are not currently met for a mood episode most recent episode of mania hypoma nia or major depression in bipolar i or bipolar ii disorder if onset of mood symptoms occurs during pregnancy or in the 4 weeks following delivery note mood episodes can have their onset either during pregnancy or postpartum although the estimates differ according to the period of followup after delivery be tween 3 and 6 of women will experience the onset of a major depressive epi sode during pregnancy or in the weeks or months following delivery fifty percent of postpartum major depressive episodes actually begin prior to delivery thus these episodes are referred to collectively as peripartum episodes women with peripartum major depressive episodes often have severe anxiety and even panic attacks prospective studies have demonstrated that mood and anxiety symptoms during pregnancy as well as the baby blues increase the risk for a postpartum major depressive episode specifiers for bipolar and related disorders 153 peripartumonset mood episodes can present either with or without psychotic features infanticide is most often associated with postpartum psychotic episodes that are characterized by command hallucinations to kill the infant or delusions that the infant is possessed but psychotic symptoms can also occur in severe postpar tum mood episodes without such specific delusions or hallucinations postpartum mood major depressive or manic episodes with psychotic features appear to occur in from 1 in 500 to 1 in 1000 deliveries and may be more common in primiparous women the risk of postpartum episodes with psychotic features is particularly increased for women with prior postpartum mood episodes but is also elevated for those with a prior history of a depressive or bipolar disorder especially bipolar i disorder and those with a family history of bipolar disorders once a woman has had a postpartum episode with psychotic features the risk of recurrence with each subsequent delivery is between 30 and 50 postpartum episodes must be differentiated from delirium occurring in the postpartum period which is distinguished by a fluctuating level of awareness or attention the postpar tum period is unique with respect to the degree of neuroendocrine alterations and psychosocial adjustments the potential impact of breastfeeding on treatment plan ning and the longterm implications of a history of postpartum mood disorder on sub sequent family planning with seasonal pattern this specifier applies to the lifetime pattern of mood episodes the essential feature is a regular seasonal pattern of at least one type of episode ie mania hypomania or depression the other types of episodes may not follow this pat tern for example an individual may have seasonal manias but his or her depressions do not regularly occur at a specific time of year a there has been a regular temporal relationship between the onset of manic hypo manic or major depressive episodes and a particular time of the year eg in the fall or winter in bipolar i or bipolar ii disorder note do not include cases in which there is an obvious effect of seasonally related psychosocial stressors eg regularly being unemployed every winter b full remissions or a change from major depression to mania or hypomania or vice versa also occur at a characteristic time of the year eg depression disappears in the spring c in the last 2 years the individuals manic hypomanic or major depressive episodes have demonstrated a temporal seasonal relationship as defined above and no nonseasonal episodes of that polarity have occurred during that 2year period d seasonal manias hypomanias or depressions as described above substantially outnumber any nonseasonal manias hypomanias or depressions that may have occurred over the individuals lifetime note this specifier can be applied to the pattern of major depressive episodes in bipolar i disorder bipolar ii disorder or major depressive disorder recurrent the essential feature is the onset and remission of major depressive episodes at char acteristic times of the year in most cases the episodes begin in fall or winter and remit in spring less commonly there may be recurrent summer depressive epi sodes this pattern of onset and remission of episodes must have occurred during at least a 2year period without any nonseasonal episodes occurring during this period in addition the seasonal depressive episodes must substantially outnum ber any nonseasonal depressive episodes over the individuals lifetime this specifier does not apply to those situations in which the pattern is better ex plained by seasonally linked psychosocial stressors eg seasonal unemployment or school schedule major depressive episodes that occur in a seasonal pattern 154 bipolar and related disorders are often characterized by prominent energy hypersomnia overeating weight gain and a craving for carbohydrates it is unclear whether a seasonal pattern is more likely in recurrent major depressive disorder or in bipolar disorders however within the bipolar disorders group a seasonal pattern appears to be more likely in bipolar ii disorder than in bipolar i disorder in some individuals the onset of manic or hypomanic episodes may also be linked to a particular season the prevalence of wintertype seasonal pattern appears to vary with latitude age and sex prevalence increases with higher latitudes age is also a strong pre dictor of seasonality with younger persons at higher risk for winter depressive epi sodes specify if in partial remission symptoms of the immediately previous manic hypomanic or depressive episode are present but full criteria are not met or there is a period lasting less than 2 months without any significant symptoms of a manic hypomanic or major depressive episode following the end of such an episode in full remission during the past 2 months no significant signs or symptoms of the disturbance were present specify current severity severity is based on the number of criterion symptoms the severity of those symptoms and the degree of functional disability mild few if any symptoms in excess of those required to meet the diagnostic criteria are present the intensity of the symptoms is distressing but manageable and the symptoms result in minor impairment in social or occupational functioning moderate the number of symptoms intensity of symptoms andor functional impair ment are between those specified for mild and severe severe the number of symptoms is substantially in excess of those required to make the diagnosis the intensity of the symptoms is seriously distressing and unmanage able and the symptoms markedly interfere with social and occupational functioning"
